Case Study Scenario:
You are tasked with developing a Python-based 
[healthcare patient management /   airway flight management / 
 bank account management /  cabs vehicle management / 
 library book management]
automated system
for monitoring and maintaining a large-scale 
network infrastructure
spread across multiple locations.

The system should handle communication
with network devices over various protocols,
automate file transfers, send email alerts,
process and store data in an efficient manner, and
scrape data from network-related web interfaces.

The solution must be scalable,
able to handle multiple tasks concurrently, and
support robust error handling.
