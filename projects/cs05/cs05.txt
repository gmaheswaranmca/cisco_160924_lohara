write updated dictionary to a new property file called net_ifcfg.conf file.
The same write updated dictionary to json file (net_ifcfg.json) format.
In addition, test your working platform is linux or winx.
Create an empty dictionary called netinfo, keep your working os name as a key (ex: netinfo[‘winx] <or> netinfo[‘linux’]) .
Based on the the os, execute the following commands and append the command results to a list.
Add the command -result-list as value to netinfo dictionary. Also add the netinfo dictionary to existing net_ifcfg.json file.
