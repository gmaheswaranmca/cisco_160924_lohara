Case Study Scenario:
A large-scale manufacturing company requires a Python-based automated inventory management system to streamline the tracking, procurement, and
usage of raw materials and finished goods.

The system needs to integrate with various
production units, warehouse systems, and
supplier networks to ensure optimal stock levels, minimize production delays, and
avoid overstocking or stockouts.

The system should monitor the real-time
availability of materials,
automate reordering when inventory falls below a predefined threshold, and

manage the transfer of raw materials between warehouses.
It should also generate reports on inventory turnover, forecast future demand based on historical data, and send alerts for any discrepancies or delays in
shipments.

The system must support concurrent processes to handle inventory updates from multiple production units simultaneously and
ensure data security across all departments.
