You're correct that Windows 11 
does not include a Telnet server by default in its Windows features, 
unlike earlier versions of Windows. 
However, you can still set up a Telnet server on Windows 11 
using third-party software. One commonly used option is Cygwin, 
which provides a Linux-like environment for Windows and allows you 
to run a Telnet server. Here's how you can set it up:

Steps to Set Up a Telnet Server on Windows 11 using Cygwin
1. Download and Install Cygwin:
   - Go to the [Cygwin website](https://www.cygwin.com/) and 
   download the setup-x86_64.exe installer for 64-bit Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the installation process.

2. Select Telnet Server Packages:
   During the installation, you'll be prompted to select packages. 
   To install a Telnet server:
   
   - In the Select Packages screen, search for `telnet`.
   - Under the `Net` category, 
   select `inetutils` 
   (this includes the Telnet server and other networking utilities).
   - Under the `Admin` category, select `xinetd` 
   (this is required to manage the Telnet server).
   
   Complete the installation process.

3. Configure xinetd for Telnet:
   Once Cygwin is installed, 
   you need to configure `xinetd` 
   to manage the Telnet service.

   - Open a Cygwin terminal as an administrator.
   - Create or edit the Telnet configuration file by running:
     ```bash
     nano /etc/xinetd.d/telnet
     ```

   - Add the following configuration to enable the Telnet service:
     ```bash
     service telnet
     {
          flags           = REUSE
          socket_type     = stream
          wait            = no
          user            = root
          server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
          log_on_failure  += USERID
          disable         = no
     }
     ```

   - Save the file (press `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and press `Enter`).

4. Start the xinetd service:
   To start the Telnet server, run the following command 
   in the Cygwin terminal:
   ```bash
   /usr/sbin/xinetd
   ```

   This will start the `xinetd` service and 
   allow Telnet connections.

5. Test the Telnet Server:
   You can now test your Telnet server 
   by connecting to it using a Telnet client. 
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost
   ```

6. Run the Telnet Server Automatically:
   If you'd like the Telnet server to run automatically 
   when Windows starts, 
   you can create a Windows Task Scheduler task 
   that runs `xinetd` on system startup. Here's how:
   
   - Open Task Scheduler and create a new task.
   - Set the action to start a program and 
   specify the path to `xinetd` 
   in the Cygwin installation folder 
   (usually `C:\cygwin64\usr\sbin\xinetd`).
   - Set the trigger to run on system startup.

Alternative: Use an SSH Server Instead of Telnet

If you're setting up a remote shell and security is a concern, 
using SSH (Secure Shell) is a much better alternative to Telnet. 
You can install an SSH server using:

- OpenSSH Server (which is included as a feature in Windows 11). 
Here's how to enable it:
    1. Open Settings > Apps > Optional Features.
    2. Click Add a feature.
    3. Search for and install OpenSSH Server.
    4. After installation, open the Services app, 
    find OpenSSH Server, and start it.
    5. You can now connect to your machine via SSH 
    (using an SSH client like `ssh` or `Putty`).
