Solution 1: Combined Operations with List, Tuple, Set, Frozenset, Dictionary, and File

```python
import json

def combined_operations():
    # Step 1: Get a list of integers from the user
    user_input = input("Enter at least 5 integers (separated by spaces): ")
    int_list = list(map(int, user_input.split()))

    # Step 2: Convert the list to a tuple and display it
    int_tuple = tuple(int_list)
    print(f"Original list: {int_list}")
    print(f"Converted tuple: {int_tuple}")

    # Step 3: Convert the list to a set and remove any duplicates
    int_set = set(int_list)
    print(f"Converted set (removing duplicates): {int_set}")

    # Step 4: Convert the set to a frozenset and display it
    int_frozenset = frozenset(int_set)
    print(f"Converted frozenset: {int_frozenset}")

    # Step 5: Create a dictionary where the keys are integers and the values are their squares
    square_dict = {num: num  2 for num in int_frozenset}
    print(f"Dictionary of squares: {square_dict}")

    # Step 6: Write the dictionary to a JSON file
    with open('squares.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(square_dict, file)
    print("Writing dictionary to file...")

    # Step 7: Read the file and print its contents
    print("Reading from file...")
    with open('squares.json', 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        print(data)

combined_operations()

Solution 2: List and Tuple Operations with File Handling

```python
def list_tuple_file_operations():
    # Step 1: Get a list of words from the user
    user_input = input("Enter words (separated by spaces): ")
    word_list = user_input.split()

    # Step 2: Convert the list into a tuple
    word_tuple = tuple(word_list)

    # Step 3: Write the list and tuple to a text file
    with open('list_tuple.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"List: {word_list}\n")
        file.write(f"Tuple: {word_tuple}\n")
    
    print(f"List: {word_list}")
    print(f"Tuple: {word_tuple}")
    print("Data written to file.")

    # Step 4: Read the contents of the file and print them
    print("Reading from file:")
    with open('list_tuple.txt', 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())

Solution 3: Set Operations and Dictionary Creation

```python
import json

def set_operations_with_dictionary():
    # Step 1: Input a list of student names
    student_names = input("Enter student names (separated by spaces): ").split()

    # Step 2: Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    student_set = set(student_names)
    print(f"Set (no duplicates): {student_set}")

    # Step 3: Convert the set to a frozenset
    student_frozenset = frozenset(student_set)
    print(f"Frozenset: {student_frozenset}")

    # Step 4: Create a dictionary with names and their lengths
    name_length_dict = {name: len(name) for name in student_frozenset}
    print(f"Dictionary of name lengths: {name_length_dict}")

    # Step 5: Write the dictionary to a JSON file
    with open('student_names.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(name_length_dict, file)
    print("Dictionary written to JSON file.")

    # Step 6: Read from the JSON file and display the contents
    print("Reading from JSON file...")
    with open('student_names.json', 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        print(data)

set_operations_with_dictionary()
```

Solution 3: Number Set and File Handling

```python
import json

def number_set_file_handling():
    # Step 1: Input 10 unique integers from the user
    user_input = input("Enter 10 unique integers: ")
    number_list = list(map(int, user_input.split()))

    # Step 2: Convert the list into a set to remove any duplicates
    number_set = set(number_list)
    print(f"Set of numbers: {number_set}")

    # Step 3: Convert the set to a frozenset
    number_frozenset = frozenset(number_set)
    print(f"Frozenset: {number_frozenset}")

    # Step 4: Create a dictionary where keys are numbers and values are cubes
    cube_dict = {num: num ** 3 for num in number_frozenset}
    print(f"Dictionary of cubes: {cube_dict}")

    # Step 5: Write the dictionary to a file in JSON format
    with open('cubes.json', 'w') as file:
        json.dump(cube_dict, file)
    print("Dictionary written to JSON file.")

    # Step 6: Read the file and display the dictionary
    print("Reading from JSON file...")
    with open('cubes.json', 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
        print(data)

number_set_file_handling()
```
