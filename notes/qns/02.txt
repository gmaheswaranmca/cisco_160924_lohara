Question 1: Frequency of Elements Using Dictionary and File
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes a list of integers from the user.
2. Creates a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers and 
the values are their frequencies in the list.
3. Write this dictionary to a file.
4. Read the file and print the dictionary.

Sample Output:
```
Enter integers (separated by spaces): 4 2 7 4 9 2 4
Frequency dictionary: {4: 3, 2: 2, 7: 1, 9: 1}
Dictionary written to file.
Reading from file...
{4: 3, 2: 2, 7: 1, 9: 1}
```

Question 2: Set Operations and Tuple Creation
Write a Python program that:
1. Accepts a string input from the user.
2. Splits the string into words and stores them in a list.
3. Removes duplicate words using a set.
4. Converts the set to a frozenset.
5. Create a tuple where each element is the length of each word in the frozenset.
6. Print the tuple.

Sample Output:
```
Enter a sentence: Python is fun and Python is cool
List of words: ['Python', 'is', 'fun', 'and', 'Python', 'is', 'cool']
Set (no duplicates): {'fun', 'Python', 'is', 'cool', 'and'}
Frozenset: frozenset({'fun', 'Python', 'is', 'cool', 'and'})
Tuple of word lengths: (3, 6, 2, 4, 3)
```

Question 3: Creating a Dictionary from Two Lists
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for two lists of the same length: 
one for keys and one for values.
2. Create a dictionary where the keys are from the first list and 
the values are from the second list.
3. Write this dictionary to a file.
4. Read the file and print the dictionary.

Sample Output:
```
Enter keys (separated by spaces): name age city
Enter values (separated by spaces): John 25 London
Dictionary: {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'London'}
Dictionary written to file.
Reading from file...
{'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'London'}
```

Would you like me to provide solutions for these as well?
